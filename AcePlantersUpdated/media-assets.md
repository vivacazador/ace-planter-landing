## Replacing Placeholder Content

To replace the placeholder content with your actual media:

1. Replace the placeholder video on the home page with an actual video showcasing Ace Planters in action. Ensure the video is optimized for web viewing.

2. Replace the placeholder product images in the carousel with high-quality photos of the Ace Planter from various angles.

3. Ensure all images are optimized for web use to maintain fast loading times.

4. If you decide to use different icons, update the imports in the respective components and replace the Lucide icons with your chosen alternatives.

## Best Practices

- Use descriptive file names for your images and videos (e.g., `ace-planter-front-view.jpg`, `planting-demo-video.mp4`).
- Store images in an `images` or `assets` folder within the `public` directory.
- Use appropriate image formats: JPEG for photographs, PNG for images that require transparency, and SVG for icons and logos where possible.
- Optimize all images and videos for web use to ensure fast loading times.
- Consider using responsive images with the `srcset` attribute for different screen sizes.

Remember to update this file whenever you add, remove, or change any media assets in the project.
